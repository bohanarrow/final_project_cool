        <h1>Summary</h1>
        
        <p>
            We will be creating a way to visualize several different types of particles interacting with eachother and their virtual environment.
        </p>
        
        <h1>
            Problem Description
        </h1>
        <p>
            In project 3-2, we worked with different textures and how they interact with light. For this project we will simulate how these types of particles interact with light and with their environment.

        </p>
        
        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <h3>Part 1: Baseline Plan</h3>
        <p>
            Our main goal with this project is to extend the raytracer we had previously implemented to include additional features, such as autofocus, manual focus, and flash that can simulate the capabilities of a physical camera. Some deliverables would include before and after images for flash and short videos demonstrating how autofocus and manual focus can be used and how they can change the image. Our baseline plan for these features would be having them all as command line arguments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To measure the performance, we are going to do a comparison of different lens configurations and ensure that the runtime should be around the same for all of them. For the quality, we will be basing it off of similar tests in the spec since the work done in this past project is a baseline for what we plan to implement in our project.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Part 2: Inspirational Plan</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned in our baseline plan, our main goal is to “extend the raytracer we had previously implemented to include additional features, 
            such as autofocus, manual focus, and flash that can simulate the capabilities of a physical camera.”  On top of these, if things go well 
            and we have more time to further extend this project, for a new feature, we would like to try post-processing on the produced images for 
            automatic brightness.  We will set a certain threshold to determine the middle ground for brightness to brighten an image if it’s too dark 
            or darken an image if it’s too bright.<br /> To improve our current baseline plan, we would aim to convert parameter-setting on the terminal command 
            line into an interactive part of the GUI in which the user can turn a dial or slider to change the focus or click a key or button to autofocus 
            or enable flash.

            Our main reference will be an old <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp16/article/19">spec</a> from a previous iteration of the class. We will be building off of someone’s ray tracer implementation from Project 3.
            We will also use this <a href=https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/publications/pdfs/Nayar_CVPR92.pdf>paper</a> to help make our autofocus algorithm efficient. We were also referencing this <a href=https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp21/lecture/15/cameras-and-lenses>lecture</a> for our lens-ray interactions and auto focus methods.
